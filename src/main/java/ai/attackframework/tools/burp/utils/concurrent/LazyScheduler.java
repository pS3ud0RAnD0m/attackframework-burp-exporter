/**
 * Lazily-started single-thread daemon {@link ScheduledExecutorService} owned by one class.
 *
 * <p>Centralizes the "{@code volatile} field + {@code synchronized} ensure-started + {@link Workers}
 * shutdown" pattern that every reporter and the orphan-flush path previously duplicated. Each
 * owner declares a {@code static final LazyScheduler} whose executor is created on first
 * {@link #getOrStart()} call and torn down by {@link #stop()} during UI stop or extension unload;
 * a subsequent {@link #getOrStart()} transparently recreates a fresh executor, preserving the
 * existing lazy-restart contract.</p>
 *
 * <p>Instances are thread-safe: start and stop serialize on the instance monitor, the backing
 * reference is {@code volatile} so {@link #peek()} and {@link #isStarted()} observe the most
 * recent write without locking, and {@link #stop()} delegates to {@link Workers} so shutdown
 * semantics match every other extension-owned worker.</p>
 *
 * <p>This helper does not clear reporter-specific state such as pushed-key sets or once-logged
 * flags; owners remain responsible for resetting their own session state in their own
 * {@code stop()} method after calling {@link #stop()}.</p>
